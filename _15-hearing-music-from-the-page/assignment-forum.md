### Reminder: Schedule Your Sight Singing Final

Sign-up sheets for the Sight Singing Final will be posted by jury sheets. Please remember to sign up for your fifteen-minute spot without delay. Take careful note of the day and time, because no makeup Sight Singing Finals will be given.

### Reminder: Earmaster 

This week's EarMaster assignment is due **Friday, December 13, 2019, at 5:00 p.m.**

Important note: **Be careful that you are completing the correct assignment.** If you are unsure, please show your screen to your professor or TA, *or* send a screen shot by email. 

### Reminder: Sight Singing Lesson 

Because this week is Dead Week, the sight singing lesson will be a dress rehearsal for your sight singing final. Please arrive prepared and ready to perform -- and also bring three well-reasoned questions that show evidence of your preparation. Be sure to bring your Sight Singing Final materials as a paper print-out or on your laptop or tablet. 

Questions? Please ask them on the Aural Skills Discord channel.
