title: What are Irregular Resolutions?    
---

In harmony, an *irregular resolution* is comparable to the idea of a deceptive cadence.

We say that an irregular resolution happens when a secondary dominant sets up the expectation for a dominant-to-tonic resolution in the tonicized key, but instead **the resolution appears in the “relative minor” of that key**. 

Therefore, the secondary dominant of chord IV might lead instead, unexpectedly, to chord ii.

### Piano Practice

Practice this excerpt on the piano. Now ask yourself, what would have to change for the secondary dominant to go to its *expected* resolution? Which notes would have to change?

Try now resolving the secondary dominant to its expected resolution on chord VI. Compare and contrast with the given example to notice the differences in chord quality and inversion.
