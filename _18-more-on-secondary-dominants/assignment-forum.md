### Things to Do

- The EarMaster assignment is due at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, January 31, 2020. Make sure to start your assignment well in advance of the deadline in case you experience any difficulties that might necessitate asking your section professor or TA for assistance.

- Remember to prepare the material we studied last Thursday for this week's audit.

- Please ensure you are registered for the correct section of this class. The longer you leave this, the more difficult it becomes to fix it.

### What to Prepare

- **This week's quizzes**: This week's quizzes are on syncopated rhythmic dictation (Tuesday) and compound triads (Thursday).

- **This week's sight singing lessons** will be on the material we discussed during last Thursday's lecture.
