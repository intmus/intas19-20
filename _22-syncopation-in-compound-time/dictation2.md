title: Rhythmic Dictation -- Syncopation in Compound Time

### Reviewing the Principles of Syncopation

We first began to study syncopated rhythms in Unit 12. In that chapter, we used this explanation of the principle:

*A syncopation is defined as a passage that displaces the normal accented beats of the meter, instead stressing a normally non-accented (“weak”) beat. In other words, when you perform a syncopation, you must place your articulations in a way that is “off-beat” with your conducting.*

In Unit 13, we began to work on syncopated rhythmic dictations in *simple* time. You'll recall the three broad types of syncopations that we practiced:
- a syncopation that crosses the barline 
- a syncopation that crosses the beat
- a syncopation *within* the beat

These principles apply in compound time too. In this excerpt, we can find all three types of syncopation:

### Tips for Success in Syncopated Rhythmic Dictation

- The basics -- ensure that you take careful note of the beat note and number of beats in the measure.
- Use the usual notation conventions (beaming, etc) -- the only thing that changes is the use of *ties*.
- Keep the beat strongly "in your mind's ear." If you know where the beat is at all times, you can easily assert where a syncopation has taken place. Try conducting along with your non-writing hand.
- ...and all the usual tips, such as writing a "dummy rhythm," focus on error detection, and so on.
