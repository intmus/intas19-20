title: What Are Compound Intervals?
---

In Aural Skills III, we studied **simple intervals.** These may be defined as "intervals that span up to, and including, one octave."

In Aural Skills IV, we will study **compound intervals.** A compound interval spans **more** than one octave.

### Why? Why?

As we advance in our study of hearing increasingly complicated melodies, chords, and four-part harmonies, we will need compound intervals to explain their analysis and notation. 

### ... But don't panic...

Compound intervals are not harder to identify and notate than simple intervals. A compound interval such as the minor 14th -- which we still spell as *sol, fa* -- also has the characteristic "dominant function" sound that you learned to identify in Aural Skills III. 

**Analyzing and notating compound intervals is a three-step process.**

1. Identify the interval as it might appear in simple presentation, i.e. you might hear *do* and *mi*, indicating a major 3rd (see the image below).
2. Add 7. This gives you a major 10th. Write "M10."
3. Now notate the second pitch in the score, taking care to use the correct octave.
