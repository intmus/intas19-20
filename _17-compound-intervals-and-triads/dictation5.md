title: Harmony - Introduction to Secondary Dominants
---

### Building on existing skills

In harmonic dictations in Aural Skills III, we identified harmonies by internalizing the logic of root movement and chord progression. We will continue to do so -- now, adding the new topic of **secondary dominants.**

### Definition

A secondary dominant occurs when we briefly **tonicize** a key by having a dominant-to-tonic progression in that key.

### How to hear secondary dominants

Secondary dominants are relatively easy to identify, because you will hear a chord containing accidentals that do not occur within the existing key signature. The root movement will indicate the chord that is being tonicized.

### A characteristic example

![Secondary Dominant 1]({{ '/images/Unit17secdom1.jpg' | absolute_url }})

- Notice the C-sharp on measure 1, beat 2: this indicates *ti* of the tonicized key. 
- The root movement also indicates which key is to be tonicized. Notice the ascending perfect fourth between A and D. This is the *sol* and *do* of the tonicized key.
