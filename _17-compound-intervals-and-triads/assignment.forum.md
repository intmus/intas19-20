### Things to Do

- The first assignment is due at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, January 24, 2020. If you haven't already purchased your EarMaster voucher from the campus bookstore, please do so immediately. Please also start your assignment well in advance of the deadline in case you experience any difficulties that might necessitate asking your section professor or TA for assistance.

- Sight singing lessons start this week. Please ensure you have prepared the correct assignment (i.e. the one studied in class on January 16).

- Please ensure you are registered for the correct section of this class. The longer you leave this, the more difficult it becomes to fix it.

### What to Prepare

- **This week's quizzes**: This week's quizzes are on modal scales (Tuesday) and compound intervals (Thursday).

- **Next week's quizzes**: The quizzes for *next* week will be on rhythmic dictation with syncopations (Tuesday) and compound triads in root position and first inversion (Thursday).

- **This week's sight singing lesson** will be on the material we discussed during the Thursday 1/16/20 lecture. Please prepare the materials listed in the Unit 16 chapter.

- **Next week's sight singing lessons** will be on the materials listed in this chapter (Unit 17), and will be tested in the week beginning Monday 1/27/19.
