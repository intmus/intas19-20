### Inverting Seventh Chords: Second Inversion

In Unit 4, we studied five different types of seventh chords (dd, dm, mm, Mm, MM) in root position and first inversion.

When we notate chords in inversions using figured bass, we abbreviate the intervallic relationships in the chord from lowest to highest pitch using the following shorthand.

This week we are going to study seventh chords in **second inversion**, which we notate using the abbreviation **4/3**. Please commit the table below to memory for easy recall.

Position  |  Intervallic Relation  |  Abbreviation
---  |  ---  |  --- 
Root Position  |  1-3-5-7 |   7   
First Inversion  |  1-3-5-6  |  6/5   
**Second Inversion**   |   **1-3-4-6**   |   **4/3**   
Third Inversion   |   1-2-4-6   |   4/2   

In other words, every 4/3 chord will be composed of a third between the two lowest pitches, with a second in the middle, and a third stacked on top. The quality of the intervals is determined by the chord quality. Please also memorize the following information:

**salient features**   |   This chord may appear in 4/3 presentation in music. In this class, always ID it as root position.   |      |   Symmetrical   |  Symmetrical    |   Only 4/3 chord to have m2   

### Piano and Singing Practice

Practice singing and playing these chords daily. Ask yourself: how are the intervallically similar and different from one another? 

### Methods for quick identification of 7th chords in all inversions:

- Determine your inversion by listening for the interval of a 2nd. If you cannot hear a 2nd....
....the chord must be in root position (now determine quality)
....or the chord could be dd (ID as root position regardless -- since m3 and A2 are enharmonically equivalent, you are not expected to differentiate between them).

- If you heard a 2nd, where in the chord is it? If it’s between the two middle notes, the inversion is 4/3. (If it’s between the top two notes, it’s 6/5, and if it’s between the two lowest notes, it’s 4/2.)

- Figure out what kind of 2nd it is. If it is a minor 2nd, the quality can only be MM.

- If you heard a major 2nd, determine the chord quality (dm, mm, or Mm) by examining the 3rds.

- Notate your chord according to the chart above. Check your notation:
intervallically, referring to the types of 2nds and 3rds that comprise the chord.
using solfege, relating your answer to key and harmonic function.
