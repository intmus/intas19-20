title: Introduction to the Neapolitan Chord

### The Theory of the Neapolitan Chord

- The **Neapolitan chord**, also known as the Neapolitan Sixth because it almost always appears in first inversion, describes a major triad whose root is the lowered supertonic. The solfege syllables of the chord are *ra, fa,* and *le*. **However, since it appears in first inversion, we usually describe the solfege of the Neapolitan chord as *fa-le-ra.***
- Therefore, if you suspect you have heard a Neapolitan chord in a harmonic dictation, listen out for *fa* in the bass.
- It is acceptable to spell the chord analysis as N<sup>6</sup> or as &#9837;II<sup>6</sup>.
- **Function**: the Neapolitan chord precedes the dominant, often substituting for IV, iv, ii<sup>6</sup>, or ii<sup>06</sup>. It most commonly appears in minor keys, though it is possible for it to appear in major keys also.

### In Context -- Harmonic Dictation

- Notice *fa* in the bass, plus the telltale *ra* in the soprano voice. That's how we know this isn't chord iv or ii<sup>06</sup>.
- For voice-leading reasons, it's quite common for i<sup>6/4</sup> to come between the Neapolitan chord and the dominant. (You'll recall that i<sup>6/4</sup> has dominant function.) In the following example, adding i<sup>6/4</sup> between the Neapolitan chord and V<sup>7</sup> means the soprano doesn't have to sing *ra-ti*, which many singers find awkward.

- For voice-leading reasons, it's quite common for i<sup>6/4</sup> to come between the Neapolitan chord and the dominant. (You'll remember that i<sup>6/4</sup> has dominant function too.)

### In Context -- Singing

- Please practice singing the following exercise in a variety of key signatures until you feel comfortable building a Neapolitan chord from any given tonic. 
- You will be asked in your final audit to build a Neapolitan chord, so take steps to become adept at this now.
