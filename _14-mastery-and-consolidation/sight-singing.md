## Review: Preparations for the Musical Elements portion

###Intervals: 
Please review the appropriate solfege choices in the table below. Important: you will lose points if, for example, you're asked to sing a minor seventh and you attempt to perform *do, te.* There is no context for this. Use *sol, fa*, the commonest context for the interval.

|**Interval Name**   |**Abbreviation**|**Recommended Ascending Solfege (Major *and* Minor Keys)**|

### Triads

Please review the principles of identifying and notating triads from Unit 2.

- The **major triad** is composed of a stacked major third plus minor third. The two commonest ways it appears in diatonic harmony are as chord I in a major key (*do-mi-sol*), and chord V (*sol-ti-re*) in major AND minor keys. It's also very common for it to appear as chord IV in major keys (*fa-la-do*).

- The **minor triad** is composed of a stacked minor third plus major third. It also occurs within the diatonic scale. In minor keys, it appears most commonly as chord i (*do-me-sol*). In major keys, it appears commonly as chord ii (*re-fa-la*)and as chord vi (*la-do-mi*).

- The **diminished triad** is composed of two stacked minor thirds. It functions as chord vii0 in both major and minor keys, as well as chord ii0 in minor keys. In this class, we will *always* spell this chord *ti-re-fa* when we are singing it outside of a melodic or harmonic context. **Please don’t attempt to spell or sing the diminished triad *do-me-se.* Not all chords relate to *do*, and this spelling has no context in diatonic music.**

- The **augmented triad** is composed of two stacked major thirds. It is relatively rare in diatonic harmony. It doesn’t naturally occur within the tones of the diatonic scale, and sounds very chromatic. For this reason, many learners find it hard to sing. When it does occur, it is usually spelled *sol-ti-ri* and appears as a chromatic variant of the dominant (*sol-ti-re*).

**Play all triads and their inversions on the piano in a variety of keys. In addition, practice singing this triads workout in a variety of keys.**
