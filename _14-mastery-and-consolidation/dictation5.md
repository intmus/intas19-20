### Two Procedures for Modal Scales

As you know, there are two procedures by which we can name solfege syllables in the modal scales. Both procedures are relevant to the study of diatonic music using solfege because modes appear in different contexts. Both procedures are good ones, so pick the one that works most successfully for you.

- One method **relates all modes to the major scale**, simply starting on different solfege degrees (i.e. the Dorian scale is labeled *re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do-re*).
- Another method has **all modes begin on *do*** and adjust the solfege syllables accordingly to allow for the chromaticism that defines the mode (i.e. the Dorian scale is labeled *do-re-me-fa-sol-la-te-do*).

In Unit 13, we studied flow charts that helped differentiate the modes using the first method. We can, of course, use the other method to categorize all the scales and modes studied so far into three broad groups: "major-sounding," "minor-sounding," and "1/2 step below the lowest two pitches."
