### The Theory of Melodic Intervals

In Unit 1, we began the study of simple intervals in their most logical melodic contexts within *major* keys. In Unit 8, we added logical melodic contexts in *minor* keys to the logical solfege possibilities for the intervals.

Interval recognition and notation is easy as long as you can quickly do the following:
- contextualize them in a melody that is well known to you
- identify their solfege
- place the given starting pitch within a key signature
- notate accordingly

For example, you may hear this interval:

![P4]({{ '/images/Week14intervals3.jpg' | absolute_url }}){:target='_blank'}

Using the above procedure, you might:
- place it within the context of "Here Comes the Bride" 
- recognize that it is a perfect fourth - *sol, do*
- label the starting pitch of A-flat as *do*. If A-flat = *do*, *do* must be D-flat
- The key signature of D-flat major is, of course, five flats. Therefore, the second pitch must be notated as a D-flat.

**Suggested Melodic Contexts**

The images below show some possible melodic contexts for the intervals. Don't know these songs? Check out the Spotify playlist **"UI Aural Skills III Simple Intervals In Context"** by user **mirandawilson**.

If these examples aren't personally meaningful to you, there are lots of sites around the internet with different suggestions. Get creative and invent your own chart!
