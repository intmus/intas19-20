### The Theory of Melodic Intervals

In Unit 1, we began the study of simple intervals in their most logical melodic contexts within *major* keys. In Unit 8, we added logical melodic contexts in *minor* keys to the logical solfege possibilities for the intervals.

Interval recognition and notation is easy as long as you can quickly do the following:
- contextualize them in a melody that is well known to you
- identify their solfege
- place the given starting pitch within a key signature
- notate accordingly

For example, you may hear this interval:

![P4]({{ '/images/Week14intervals3.jpg' | relative_url }}){:target='_blank'}

Using the above procedure, you might:
- place it within the context of "Here Comes the Bride" 
- recognize that it is a perfect fourth - *sol, do*
- label the starting pitch of A-flat as *do*. If A-flat = *do*, *do* must be D-flat
- The key signature of D-flat major is, of course, five flats. Therefore, the second pitch must be notated as a D-flat.

### Suggested Melodic Contexts

The images below show some possible melodic contexts for the intervals. If these examples aren't personally meaningful to you, there are lots of sites around the internet with different suggestions. Get creative and invent your own chart!

![P4]({{ '/images/Week14intervals1.jpg' | relative_url }}){:target='_blank'}
![P4]({{ '/images/Week14intervals2.jpg' | relative_url }}){:target='_blank'}
