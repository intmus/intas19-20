title: Harmonic Dictation Exam Review

### General guidelines

- First hearing: listen to overall color of harmony, noticing chromatic tones, cadence types, pre-cadential chords, etc. Are there secondary dominants? Augmented sixth chords? Neapolitan chords? Borrowed chords? Irregular resolutions? Make some analysis predictions.
- First and second hearings: write your bass notes in as soon as possible. This voice will determine not only the chord, but the inversion. Further refine your analysis predictions.
- First, second, and third hearings: write in the soprano notes. These are useful as a confirmation of predicted harmonies, or a clarification between two possible different outcomes.
- Final hearing: check your work according to principles of harmonic progression and voice-leading, and use the clues from the soprano and bass voice to eliminate possible wrong answers. The final hearing is also a good time to check whether dominant chords have a seventh degree, for example.

### Chord progression rules

Review and memorize the rules of chord progression. This will save you a great deal of time figuring out your Roman numeral analysis.

### Procedures for possible harmonies

**Root movement**

- Review the rules of root movement in the table below:

Bass Notes | Likely Chord Pattern 
--- | ---
*do, re, mi* | I-V<sup>6/4</sup>-I<sup>6</sup> **OR** I-V<sup>4/3</sup> **OR** I-vii<sup>o6</sup>-I<sup>6</sup> 
*do, re, sol* | I-ii-V 
*do, mi, fa* | I-I<sup>6</sup>-IV 
*do, mi, sol* |  I-I<sup>6</sup>-V
*do, fa, re* |  I-IV-ii
*do, fa, mi* |  I-IV-I<sup>6</sup>
*do, fa, sol* |  I-IV-V **OR** I-vi-ii<sup>6</sup>
*do, sol, la* |  I-V-vi
*do, la, fa* |  I-vi-IV **OR** I-vi-ii<sup>6</sup>
*do, ti, do* |  I-V<sup>6/5</sup>-I **OR** I-V<sup>6</sup>-I

- In Units 9 and 19, we studied these rules in context in piano practice. Review the following examples at the piano, paying special attention to root movement:

**Secondary Dominants**

![Secondary Dominant Example 2]({{ '/images/Unit19secdom2.JPG' | absolute_url }})

![Secondary Dominant Example 3]({{ '/images/Unit19secdom3.JPG' | absolute_url }})

![Secondary Dominant Example 4]({{ '/images/Unit19secdom4.JPG' | absolute_url }})

![Secondary Dominant Example 5]({{ '/images/Unit19secdom5.JPG' | absolute_url }})


**Neapolitan chord**

- Commit the solfege of the Neapolitan chord to memory: *fa-le-ra.* Remember, the Neapolitan chord always appears in first inversion.
- Sing the Neapolitan chord procedure:

![Neapolitan 3]({{ '/images/Unit26neapolitan3.jpg' | absolute_url }})
- Play the Neapolitan chord on the piano to hear how it functions in context:
![Neapolitan 1]({{ '/images/Unit26neapolitan1.jpg' | absolute_url }})
![Neapolitan 2]({{ '/images/Unit26neapolitan2.jpg' | absolute_url }})

**Augmented sixth chords**

Memorize the solfege of the three types of augmented sixth chord, and the salient features of each:
- Italian sixth = *le-do-fi* (only 3 tones)
- German sixth = *le-do-me-fi* (enharmonic equivalent of the major-minor seventh chord, though greatly different in solfege and function!)
- French sixth = *le-do-re-fi* (composed of a partial whole tone collection, and therefore very dissonant)

- Sing the augmented sixth chords:

![Augmented 4]({{ '/images/Unit26augmented4.jpg' | absolute_url }})
- Play augmented sixth chords on the piano to hear how they function in context:
![Augmented 1]({{ '/images/Unit26augmented1.JPG' | absolute_url }})
![Augmented 2]({{ '/images/Unit26augmented2.JPG' | absolute_url }})
![Augmented 3]({{ '/images/Unit26augmented3.JPG' | absolute_url }})

**Borrowed chords**

- Memorize the possibilities for borrowed chords: therefore, in major keys, ii<sup>o</sup>, ii<sup>∅7</sup>, ♭III, iv, ♭VI, vii<sup>o7</sup>, etc.
- Practice the following progressions on the piano to easily recall the ways in which we can borrow chords from the parallel mode:
![Picardy3rd]({{ '/images/Unit29borrowedchords1.jpg' | absolute_url }})
![flat6]({{ '/images/Unit29borrowedchords2.jpg' | absolute_url }})
![minoriv]({{ '/images/Unit29borrowedchords6.jpg' | absolute_url }})
![multipleborrowings]({{ '/images/Unit29borrowedchords4.jpg' | absolute_url }})

**Irregular resolutions**

- Remember, irregular resolutions are comparable to a deceptive cadence, but in the context of a secondary dominant. Practice this example of what they sound like:
