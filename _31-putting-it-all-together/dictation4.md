### Inverting Seventh Chords

Review the following table of the inversions and spellings of seventh chords.

Position  |  Intervallic Relation  |  Abbreviation
---  |  ---  |  --- 
Root Position  |  1-3-5-7 |   7   
First Inversion  |  1-3-5-6  |  6/5   
Second Inversion   |   1-3-4-6   |   4/3   
Third Inversion   |   1-2-4-6   |   4/2 

### Piano Practice - Inverting Seventh Chords

Review how the inversions of the seventh chords feel under your fingers on the piano keyboard. Play them blocked, then arpeggiated. Notice how they are similar to, and different from each other. Improvise contexts for them using your knowledge of chord progressions and voice-leading.

### Singing Practice - Seventh Chords in Solfege and Context

Review this singing warm-up, paying special attention to finding your intervals in a vocally independent manner (i.e. with minimal reference to pitches on the piano).

### Compound Seventh Chords - Intervallic Relations

Review the following table of intervallic relations within compound seventh chords. Memorize these rules for easy recall.

 (intervallic relation) | **fully diminished (dd)** | **half diminished (dm)** | **minor-minor (mm)** | **major-minor (Mm)** | **major-major (MM)** 
**contains tritones?** | 2 (*ti-fa*, *re-le*) | 1 (*ti-fa* OR *re-le*) | 0 | 1 (*ti-fa*) | 0 
**contains P5 or P4?** | no | 1 (*re-la* OR *fa-do*) | 2 (*re-la* and *fa-do* OR *la-mi* and *do-sol*) | 1 (*sol-re*) | 2 (*do-sol*, *mi-ti*) 
**what type of 7th?** | diminished (*ti-le*) | minor (*ti-la* OR *re-do*) | minor (*re-do* OR *la-sol*) | minor (*sol-fa*) | major (*do-ti*)

### Piano Practice - Inversions and Contexts

Practice the following contexts for compound seventh chords at the piano. Notice the voice-leading, and play the chords both blocked and arpeggiated, as well as playing the four voices separately to hear their linear shapes.
