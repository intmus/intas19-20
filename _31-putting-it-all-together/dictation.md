 ### Recommended Solfege for Simple Intervals

Here again is the chart of simple intervals and their recommended solfege from Unit 1. Memorize the solfege for easy recall:

### Study Skills - Flow Chart

Flow charts are invaluable in helping us identify correct answers and eliminate errors when we are under pressure in an exam. Review the flow chart below for easy categorization of intervals.

### Simple vs. Compound

It isn't hard to "translate" simple intervals into the compound intervals we are now studying. For reference, here is a compound intervals cheat sheet. The procedure? Simply identify the interval and add 7...
