### Three-Chord Progressions
Here is an example of the type of three-chord progression we will study this week.

### Systematic Steps

- **Big-picture listening:** "I'm listening to the overall color of the progression. *All the chords sound like major triads.*" (Remember this, it's important.)

- **Bass note possibilities:** "Now I'm focusing my listening on the bass voice. Sounds like *do-re-mi*. *Do* in the bass? Probably chord I. *Re* in the bass? Could be chord ii... Wait, chord V also has *re* in it... To have *re* as the bass note, it would have to be in second inversion -- V<sup>6/4</sup>. *Mi*? The most likely explanation is chord I<sup>6</sup>. Because *it's not chord iii.* Chord iii is very unlikely, plus, it's a minor chord and I already established all the chords were major triads."

- **Chordal analysis using logic:** "If the third chord in the progression is I<sup>6</sup>, then the second chord in the progression can't be chord ii, *because ii can't go to I*." (Why not? See the table of chord progressions in Unit 9.)

- **Soprano notes and confirmation of hypotheses:** "I hear *mi-re-do.* That makes sense, because *mi* is part of I, *re* is part of V <sup>6/4</sup>, and *do* is part of I<sup>6</sup>." (Theory behind this: the "passing 6/4" that we see in the above example is one of three very specific uses of the second inversion triad. We'll get to the other two -- pedal and cadential -- in due course.)

- **Use final hearing to check work.** "Are my analyses consistent with the pitches I've notated?" "Are my chord identifications consistent with the rules about chord progressions?"
