title: Ear Training - Root Movement in Chord Progressions
---

### Analysis

When analyzing a harmonic progression, start by listening to the root movement, i.e. the bass note. This will help you greatly in predicting the progression. Remember, there are strict rules about which chords can go to which.

- Bass movement *do, re, mi*: first-time learners are often tempted to analyze this root movement as a predictor for **I-ii-iii.** But this progression is not possible: while chord **I** can definitely go to chord **ii**, **ii** cannot go to **iii**.

**I-V<sup>6/4</sup>-I<sup>6</sup>** is a logical choice, because the second inversion dominant triad (known as "the passing 6/4") leads smoothly into the first inversion tonic triad.

- Bass movement *do, re, mi* has other possibilities. Here, the dominant function is taken by **vii<sup>o6</sup>.**

- Bass movement *do, re, sol*: *re* in the bass voice indicates chord **ii**, which has pre-dominant function. It is therefore very logical to propose that the next chord is **V**.

- Bass movement *do, mi, fa*: **Many will be tempted to identify a chord with *mi* in the bass as chord iii. Don't fall into that trap. *Mi* in the bass almost always signifies I<sup>6</sup>, not iii.**

- Bass movement *do, mi, sol*: **Again, *mi* in the bass signifies I<sup>6</sup>, *not* iii.**

- Bass movement *do, fa, re*: it is possible for **IV** to precede **ii.**

- Bass movement *do, fa, mi*: again, *mi* in the bass is *not* chord **iii**.

- Bass movement *do, fa, sol*: this indications a pre-dominant function on the second chord. In the first example, the chord is **ii<sup>6</sup>**, and in the second example, it's **IV**. **ii<sup>6</sup>** is easily confused with chord **IV** because the bass note is the same. **Tip: identify these by their chord qualities. Chord ii, as you know, is minor, whereas chord IV is major.**

![Piano Practice 3]({{ '/images/Week9rootmovement3.jpg' | relative_url }}){:target='_blank'}

- Bass movement *do, sol, la* indicates **I-V-vi**, i.e. a deceptive cadence.

- Bass movement *do, la, fa* here indicates the "doo-wop" progression we studied earlier in this chapter. The **I-vi-IV** progression can easily be confused with its variant, **I-vi-ii<sup>6</sup>, so again, check the chord quality before making an analysis.

- Bass movement *do, ti, do* isn't necessarily **I-vii<sup>o</sup>-I.** Here, it indicates **I-V<sup>6/5</sup>-I.**

### Remember:

Chord patterns in harmonic dictation are both **logical** and **predictable.** There are no trick questions here. If you play the examples in this chapter repeatedly until you have memorized the sound and feel of them in your daily piano practice, you will greatly increase your speed and accuracy in identifying them in quizzes.
