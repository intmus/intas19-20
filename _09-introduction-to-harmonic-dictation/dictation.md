### What Happens in Harmonic Dictation?

In harmonic dictation quizzes, the instructor will play a tonic triad, then a chord progression in four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) on the piano. You will notate the soprano and bass voices, and analyze the harmony under the staff using Roman numerals and figured bass. 

### The Logic of Chord Progressions

In diatonic music, chords progress according to the highly rational, consistent rules of voice-leading. Therefore, harmonic dictations in this class will conform to the following rules of chord progression.

In major keys, chords progress like this:

![Chord Progressions in Major]({{ '/images/Week9MajorProgression.jpg' | absolute_url }}){:target='_blank'}

In minor keys, chords progress like this:

![Chord Progressions in Minor]({{ '/images/Week9MinorProgression.jpg' | absolute_url }}){:target='_blank'}

If you commit these rules to memory, it will help you avoid analysis errors.
