### Things to Do

- The EarMaster assignment is due at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, April 24, 2020. Make sure to start your assignment well in advance of the deadline in case you experience any difficulties that might necessitate asking your section professor or TA for assistance.

- Remember to prepare the material we discussed in last Thursday's lecture for this week's sight singing lesson.

### What to Prepare

- **This week's quizzes**: This week's quizzes are on harmonic compound intervals (Tuesday) and harmonic dictation (which may contain any of the above: secondary dominants, Neapolitan chords, augmented sixth chords, or our new topic of borrowed chords) (Thursday).

- **This week's sight singing lessons** will be on the material prepared last week.
