### What are we borrowing from?

**Borrowed chords** are another method composers use to add an element of color and surprise to harmony. This procedure, also known as “modal mixture,” is **when a composer borrows a chord from the parallel key** (a major or minor scale with the same tonic). 

### A familiar borrowing

You are likely familiar with the most common type of borrowed chord, the **Picardy third** (also known by its French title, the *tierce de Picardie*). This is when major chord I appears in a minor key, often at a final cadence.

### Other borrowed chords

In **major keys**, the most common borrowed chords from the parallel minor mode are:
- ii<sup>o</sup>
- ii<sup>∅7</sup> 
- ♭III
- iv
- ♭VI
- vii<sup>o7</sup>

Commit these facts to memory for easy recall.
