### Things to Do

- The EarMaster assignment is due at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, February 21, 2020. Make sure to start your assignment well in advance of the deadline in case you experience any difficulties that might necessitate asking your section professor or TA for assistance.

- Remember to prepare the material we studied in last Thursday's class for this week's sight singing lesson.

### What to Prepare

- **This week's quizzes**: This week's quizzes are on melodic dictation with syncopations (Tuesday) and harmonic dictation with secondary dominants (Thursday).

- **This week's sight singing lesson** will be on the material we discussed during last Thursday's class lecture. Please prepare the materials listed in Unit 20.

- **This week's Spotify playlist** features several examples of modulating melody. Listen to each example several times and try to pinpoint where key changes take place.
