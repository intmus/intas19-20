title: Harmonic Dictation - Secondary Dominants in Minor Keys
---

### Root Movement and Implied Harmony

The rules for secondary dominants in minor keys are comparable to those for major keys. As with any dominant-to-tonic progression, the inversion can be determined by the movement of the bass voice (i.e. root movement). As always, we will still follow the rules of chord progression.

In this example, chord VI is tonicized.
