## Rules

You may use this Discord server to discuss your coursework in welcoming, safe space. 
Remember that even if you are not struggling, others might be, so we will have a zero-tolerance policy for behavior that could be considered bullying or overly negative. 
As such, please respect each other and the following rules:

- No inappropriate content or language. PG at all times!
- Use a civil tone for all posts. (Don't be a jerk.)
- No spamming. We love humor, but don't use so much that it is difficult to find the information.
- No self promotion without a moderator's approval. We are proud that you have gigs, but this is not the place to pester people...unless it has a specific relevance to our topics.
