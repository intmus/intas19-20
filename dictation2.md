title: Comprehensive Review of Scales
---

We have studied many types of scales: diatonic (including the diatonic modes), and non-diatonic. Now we need to come up with quick and easy ways to sort through a large amount of information on our way to finding right answers and eliminating wrong ones.

Review the following broad categories of scales, using solfege when appropriate, and listen to the playlists composed of pieces that epitomize the styles that use these scales.

### The Diatonic Scales - Major, Minors, Chromatic

### Modal Scales - IDPLMAL

There are two ways to spell modal scales using solfege, both shown below.

### Review - Categorizing Scales

Scales, even considering the large number we have learned, are *not* hard to identify and notate as long as you memorize how to categorize them so you can instantly eliminate wrong identifications. Follow this step-by-step procedure:
- Step 1: count the tones. Major, minor, modal, and Lydian dominant scales will have 8 tones (i.e. 7+1), the pentatonic scales will have 6 (5+1), the hexatonic scales will have 7 (6+1), and the octatonic scales will have 9 (8+1).
- Step 2: Once you have identified the scale's category, further refine based on the intervallic relations within the scale.
- Step 3: Now notate your scale in the staff.
- Step 4: Always check your work. For the non-diatonic scales, use a rational method such as checking via arpeggios. In the two hexatonic scales, use the arpeggiated augmented triad to check your notation; for octatonic scales, use the arpeggiated diminished triad. Be sure the first two notes are notated correctly in all these cases, since the correct interval there determines the correct notation of all following intervals.
