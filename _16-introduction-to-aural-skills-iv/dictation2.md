title: Sight Singing - Triplets in Simple Meters; Duplets in Compound Meters

### Sightreading

We will begin the sight singing lesson with a short sightreading example of approximately the difficulty of those we studied at the end of Aural Skills III. As always, please check your clef, time signature, and key signature before you start to practice. While practicing, be sure to conduct strongly and identify any troublesome solfege, melodic shapes, and rhythms that may trip you up. You will have about 60 seconds of practice time before performing for your instructor.

### Preparation for Unit 17 Sight Singing

Please click on the link below to access the sight singing assignment for next week. You must bring the assignment to your sight singing lesson. You may choose to print it out, or to view it on a laptop or tablet device. **Please do not attempt to read the assignment from your phone in the lesson. This seldom results in a high score.**

### Instructions

- When an (undotted) note value is divided in two, we can express it using the following divisions and subdivisions.
![simpledivision]({{ '/images/Unit17simpledivision.JPG' | relative_url }})
- To divide the same note value in three, we use the same note value as for the duple division, but we write three of them and indicate that the division is a triplet by means of a triplet symbol, “3,” like this:
![tripletdivision]({{ '/images/Unit17tripletdivisions.JPG' | relative_url }})
- Conversely, we can divide a dotted note value in 2 by means of the duplet symbol, “2,” like this:
![dupletdivision]({{ '/images/Unit17dupletdivisions.JPG' | relative_url }})
- In both cases, a tip for successfully performing these divisions of the beat is to make sure your conducting is very steady. Train yourself to switch your mental subdivision instantaneously between duple and triple.
